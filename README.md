# simple-musicapp

Hi there!

This repo contains a simple musician sorting app. For this app you can type in the name of the artist and the type of music they play and the app will sort them into Country, Pop, Rap, or Other. If you indicate any of the first three selections your artist will be listed under the appropriate subheading, if you list a type of music outside of this short list then the artist will be placed in the other category at the bottom of the screen along with the kind of music they play.

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS

Building this simple app was my introduction to the CRUD process and EJS. It's really a spin off the common todo list without the update feature. I chose to incorporate EJS because it was the simplest template I could use for the front end. If you already know HTML and JS then EJS is really easy to pick up, it's more or less the two combined with some few modifications.

Optimizations:

I really should have included a bit more CSS to make the app look a bit better, but it wasn't the main objective of this project and I was a bit short on time. I made the app responsive to mobile instead of making it more colorful, it was a tradeoff.

Lessons Learned:

I learned how to use EJS and most of the elements of the CRUD process. The concept is actually not that difficult to understand, I just need to sharpen my front end skills to make the app look better.
